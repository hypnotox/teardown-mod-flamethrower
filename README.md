# Teardown Mod: Flamethrower

This is a mod for the game Teardown [on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2739855429).

A flamethrower that tries to be fairly realistic. 

Currently it's using the default particle system for the flames and a custom implementation to compute which voxels should be burned. The effect should be fairly realistic for a gasoline powered flamethrower.

The mod is in active development and subject to change.
If you have any suggestions please comment.
