# Teardown Mod: Flamethrower

This is a mod for the game Teardown [on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2739855429).

A gasoline powered flamethrower that tries to be fairly realistic. 

Currently it's using the default particle system for the flames and a custom implementation to compute which voxels should be burned.

The mod is in active development and subject to change.

## Todo

- [ ] Implement options to adjust parameters
- [ ] Add nozzle adjustment for short and broad or thin and long flames
