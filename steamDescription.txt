A gasoline powered flamethrower that tries to be fairly realistic.
The mod is in active development and subject to change.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[h3]Increased fire limit[/h3]
This mod increases the fire limit. You can toggle this in the options menu.
FYI: This increases the registry value for the "hard" fire limit, the engine will still put out fires if the frame rate dips to low. On my PC this translates to about 450-550 fires simultaneously. (i5-4690k, RX 5700 XT)

[h3]Adjustable nozzle[/h3]
Holding "left arrow" or "right arrow" will close or open the nozzle respectively up to a limit, changing the pressure of the flames. The keybinds are adjustable in the options menu.

[h2]Planned features[/h2]

This is a list of features that I have committed to, other features might be in development too.

[list]
	[*]Flame deflection simulation (find inflammable voxels after deflecting from some surface)
[/list]

[h2]Infos[/h2]

Currently, it's using the default particle system for the flames and a custom implementation to compute which voxels should be burned.
