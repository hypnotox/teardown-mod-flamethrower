name = Gasoline Flamethrower
author = HypnoTox
description = A gasoline powered flamethrower that tries to be fairly realistic. 

Currently it's using the default particle system for the flames and a custom implementation to compute which voxels should be burned.

[h2]Features[/h2]

Holding "left arrow" or "right arrow" will close or open the nozzle respectively up to a limit, changing the pressure of the flames.
An options panel is planned to change the keybinds in the future.

[h3]Infos[h3]

The mod is in active development and subject to change.
If you have any suggestions or come across any bugs/problems please comment.
