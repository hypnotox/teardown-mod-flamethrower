description = A gasoline powered flamethrower that tries to be fairly realistic.

Currently it's using the default particle system for the flames and a custom implementation to compute which voxels should be burned.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[h3]Increased fire limit[/h3]
This mod increases the fire limit.
It will be possible to adjust this value or disable this in the future.

[h3]Adjustable nozzle[/h3]
Holding "left arrow" or "right arrow" will close or open the nozzle respectively up to a limit, changing the pressure of the flames.
An options panel is planned to change the keybinds in the future.

[h2]Planned features[/h2]

This is a list of features that i have commited to, other features might be in development too.

[list]
	[*]Flame deflection simulation (find inflammable voxels after deflecting from some surface)
	[*]Better nozzle implementation
	[*]Options menu (for keybinds, maybe other options as well)
[/list]

[h2]Infos[/h2]

The mod is in active development and subject to change.
